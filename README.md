# Objective

- What is the primary challenge?

The Head of Marketing aims to identify the top YouTubers of 2024 to plan effective marketing campaigns for the year.

- What is the best approach?

To build a dashboard that delivers insights into the top UK YouTubers in 2024, including their

- total views 
- subscribers
- total number of videos
- metrics for engagement
  
This will assist the marketing team in choosing which YouTubers to work with on their campaigns.

## User Story

As the Head of Marketing, I want to use a dashboard that analyses YouTube channel data in the UK .

This dashboard should allow me to identify the top performing channels based on metrics like subscriber base and average views.

With this information, I can make more informed decisions about which Youtubers are right to collaborate with, and therefore maximize how effective each marketing campaign is.

# Data Source

- What data is needed to achieve our objective?

We need data on the top UK YouTubers in 2024 that includes their 
- channel names
- total subscribers
- total views
- total videos uploaded

- Where is the data coming from? 
The data is sourced from Kaggle (an Excel extract), [see here to find it.](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anubhavbharti/top-100-youtube-channels-2024-12-countries?select=UK_Top100_YoutubeChannels.csv)

## Dashboard requirements

- What should the dashboard provide based on the specifications provided?
  
To determine what the dashboard should include, we first need to identify the key questions it needs to address:

1. Who are the top 10 YouTubers with the most subscribers?
2. Which 3 channels have uploaded the most videos?
3. Which 3 channels have the most views?
4. Which 3 channels have the highest average views per video?
5. Which 3 channels have the highest views per subscriber ratio?
6. Which 3 channels have the highest subscriber engagement rate per video uploaded?

For the time being, these are some of the questions we must address; but, as our analysis progresses, this may change.

## Dashboard mockup

- What the dashboard will look like?

The following data visuals will be most appropriate in providing solutions to the requirements:

1. Table
2. Treemap
3. Scorecards
4. Horizontal bar chart
